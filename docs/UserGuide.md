--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ClassRosterPro.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar classrosterpro.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Tagging a student with attributes : `tag`

Adds or updates descriptive attributes for a specific student, such as their subject, age, house, or CCA.
This helps you categorize and filter students more efficiently.

* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.

* Attributes can have one or multiple comma-separated values.
* If you use the same key multiple times, only the **last occurrence** is applied.
* At least one `attr/` prefix must be provided.

Examples:

### Deleting attributes from a student : `deltag`

* `deltag 2 attr/age attr/subject`
Deletes multiple attributes (age, subject) from the 3rd student.

![Result of deleting attributes](images/deltagUI.png)
<p align="center"><em>Figure: Result of deleting attributes from the student at index 2.</em></p>



### Filtering students by attributes : `filter`

Filters and displays students whose attributes match the specified criteria, helping you quickly find students with specific characteristics.

Format: `filter attr/KEY=VALUE[,VALUE2]…​ [attr/KEY2=VALUE2]…​`

* Filters students based on their tagged attributes.
* The search is case-insensitive for both attribute keys and values.
* All specified attribute filters must match for a student to be included (AND logic).
* Multiple values for the same attribute are separated by commas (OR logic within the same attribute).
* At least one `attr/` prefix must be provided.
* For age attributes, values must be valid integers.

Examples:
* `filter attr/subject=math` - Shows students tagged with "math" as their subject
* `filter attr/subject=math,science attr/age=16` - Shows students who have either "math" or "science" as subject AND are age 16

### Quick Search : `search`

Allows users to instantly search for contacts by name, email or phone number.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"> :bulb: **Tip**
You can still use the `find` command for more specific or multi-keyword searches.
The Quick Search feature is ideal for quick lookups during lessons or when managing attendance.
</div>

Examples:
* Typing `search alex` will display contacts such as `Alex Yeoh`
* Typing `search 9876` will display contacts with phone number such as 9876123

Format: `grade INDEX sub/SUBJECT/ASSESSMENT/SCORE [sub/SUBJECT2/ASSESSMENT2/SCORE2]…​`

* Records grades for the student at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* If a subject-assessment combination already exists for the student, the new score will **overwrite** the existing score.
* If the same subject-assessment appears multiple times in one command, the **last occurrence** wins.
* At least one `sub/` prefix must be provided.
* Subject, assessment, and score values cannot be empty.

Examples:
* `grade 2 sub/MATH/WA1/89 sub/SCIENCE/Quiz1/95` - Records Math WA1 score as 89 and Science Quiz1 score as 95 for the 2nd student
* `grade 5 sub/ENGLISH/Final/88 sub/HISTORY/Midterm/92` - Records English Final score as 88 and History Midterm score as 92 for the 5th student

![Result of recording grades](images/GradesUi.png)
<p align="center"><em>Figure: Result of recording grades for a student.</em></p>

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`


### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`


### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.


### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
